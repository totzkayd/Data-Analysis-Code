# Data-Analysis-Code

Here, I will provide some of the code I have been working on to assist in the analysis of social scientific data in R. While there are certainly many examples of these "out there," my goal is to write these scripts for my own easy use and for sharing with colleagues who have similar research needs and would like to begin to utilize the unique functions R has available.
